    "A house flipper's main concern is to find which homes are being sold at a lower price in the market than its supposed value. Thus, my using the price predictor from our model, we aimed to pinpoint undervalued homes. We first combined the Train and Test datasets, adding on the longitude and latitude information onto it as well. Then, we created a new column to measure the difference in actual price and predicted price. From price_table_final, we filtered out homes that had a positive price difference, which means that its predicted price is higher than the actual price that it was sold."
